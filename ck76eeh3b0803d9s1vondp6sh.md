## "El Carrillon" project  featured in the RaspberryPi magazine MagPi

Some time ago [I blogged about a fantastic project Gerardo Richarte and I were doing with an 18-bell tower located in Argentina](https://martinezpeck.hashnode.dev/developing-testing-and-mocking-the-largest-midi-instrument-of-the-world-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-a-diy-leds-piano-cjz98b31t001vpks1g3nulugc).

Back then, I showed some details of the architecture, code, and how I mocked-up “El Carrillon” with a homemade LED piano so I could test it at home.

Later on, I wrote [another post](https://martinezpeck.hashnode.dev/el-carrillon-playing-midi-songs-on-an-18-bell-tower-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-smalltalk-ck3raa1vg00s46qs1ely423ry), where you can see it running live and read some great news about the project (including an award!).

In this quick post, I am so happy to share with you some BIG NEWS:  
[El Carrillon](https://github.com/gerasdf/carrillon) is the first [VASmalltalk IoT](https://www.instantiations.com/iot/index.html) project to appear as a showcase in [the official RaspberryPi magazine, The MagPi!](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/issues/91). It was a pleasure for me to work on the project with Gerardo Richarte, and thanks to Instantiations for their support!
